Find A Recipe

Thank you for choosing Find A Recipe to search for recipes and try new tastes! Here you can find many recipes from different categories (appetizers, salads, soups, main dishes, desserts, and drinks). All recipes have a list of ingredients, well-written instructions and images to know what to expect.

Do you know a good recipe and would like to share it with the world? Great! You just have to register/login and you can add a new recipe. Also, you can write a review and rate recipes.

To create this web application, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript language for the front-end. For the back-end server, used a NodeJS server environment, because it supports JavaScript.

The biggest chalenge for me was the to build the back-end. At first, I tried to find information on the Internet from articles, blogs, podcasts, etc. Unfortunately, I felt overwhelmed as there was a lot of unstructured information that I did not know where to start. For that reason, I decided to take a course of full-stack web application development. It took me more than a month to finish it, but I am happy with my decision because I have built a working web application.

In the future, I would like to add features like searching for a recipe with a keyword or by category. Also, I would like to aprove a new recipe before it is saved in the database, and forbid other users to delete even their own recipes.

Wonder how to use my web application? It is easier than easy! Simply, enter the address https://edita-test-app.herokuapp.com/ to your browser and you are already there! From the first page you can go to the list of recipes, login or register forms. As soon as you are logged in, you can view whole recipes with full instructions (which is forbidden unless you are logged in), add or delete your recipes, reviews and ratings. Also, you can edit your recipes in my webb application.

Would you like to build a similar poject but dot know where to start? I recommend you to take the course of 'The Web Development Bootcamp 2023' on www.udemy.com.
